                                <h2>Anxiety and Panic</h2>
                                <p>
                                    Everyone feels anxious at times. There are situations
                                    however where anxiety may become more problematic and
                                    interfere with everyday functioning. Anxiety can
                                    present itself in different ways and it is usually
                                    characterised by physiological changes such as a
                                    racing heart, breathlessness and tension as your body
                                    prepares for what is sees as a threat. Thoughts are
                                    likely to be fearful and a racing mind can be common.
                                    There can be a strong tendency to avoid situations
                                    that are anxiety provoking, often restricting life.
                                    For some, anxiety may get in the way of socialising
                                    with others, for others, it may be specific situations
                                    such as public speaking that trigger anxiety. Some
                                    people develop a phobia of a particular situation,
                                    such as heights or enclosed spaces. Others may
                                    experience ongoing worries, expecting the worst to
                                    happen, or intrusive thoughts that may lead to
                                    compulsions such as hand washing or tapping, as it is
                                    the case in OCD. Therapy can help you to feel more in
                                    control of your anxiety by learning ways of coping
                                    with both the physiological aspect of anxiety and your
                                    thoughts. It can also be helpful to delve deeper into
                                    the root causes of anxiety and build an understanding
                                    of the factors and life experiences that may have
                                    contributed to it.

                                <h2>Depression</h2>
                                <p>
                                    Feeling sometimes sad, down or lacking in motivation
                                    is normal and part of being human, particularly after
                                    a disappointing experience, a loss, or at the end of a
                                    significant relationship. Depression can be
                                    characterised by persistent low mood, hopelessness,
                                    tearfulness, difficulties with motivation and loss of
                                    interest in activities that used to be enjoyable.
                                    There can also be a tendency to withdraw from family
                                    and friends. Sleep can be disrupted and sometimes
                                    depression can lead to sleeping more, at times it can
                                    lead to sleeplessness. Anger, irritability and
                                    restlessness can also be common. Often, there is a
                                    negative self-image and an internal critical part that
                                    can contribute to depression and alongside it there
                                    can be guilt and shame. Therapy can help you to
                                    understand the reasons why you may be depressed, both
                                    in terms of what is keeping depression going in the
                                    present and some of the life experiences that have
                                    contributed to it. Focusing on breaking negative
                                    cycles of thinking and taking steps to engage with
                                    valued activities can be an important part of therapy.
                                    It can also be useful to focus on patterns of relating
                                    that may be contributing to the depression and
                                    understand their connections with early experiences.

                                <h2>Trauma and PTSD</h2>
                                <p>
                                    Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a mental
                                    health condition triggered by an event or situation
                                    that is perceived as threatening, overwhelming, and
                                    upsetting. The traumatic event can be anything from a
                                    natural disaster, war, assault, or a serious accident.
                                    PTSD can manifest itself in various ways, and its
                                    symptoms can be different for everyone. Common
                                    symptoms of PTSD include intrusive thoughts or
                                    memories of the traumatic event, nightmares,
                                    flashbacks, and avoidance behaviours. Other symptoms
                                    may include irritability, anger outbursts, difficulty
                                    concentrating, and hypervigilance. Not all traumatic
                                    experience may give rise to PTSD whilst still having a
                                    significant impact. Developmental traumas and
                                    difficult experiences whilst growing up where the
                                    child’s need for safety, a secure attachment and an
                                    attuned connection are not met can affect one’s sense
                                    of self as well as the ability to manage emotions and
                                    to develop meaningful relationships with others.
                                    Therapy can provide a safe environment where you can
                                    understand the impact that difficult, traumatic,
                                    experiences may have had on you, your thoughts, your
                                    feelings and your ways of coping and relating to
                                    others. It is also possible to process traumatic
                                    memories using therapies such as EMDR to change how
                                    they are stored in the mind and loosen the impact they

                                <h2>Adjustment to Chronic Health Conditions</h2>
                                <p>
                                    Receiving a diagnosis of a chronic health condition
                                    can be challenging and bring up a lot of different
                                    thoughts and feelings. Chronic health conditions are
                                    long-term health conditions that require ongoing
                                    management and care. Examples of chronic health
                                    conditions include diabetes, arthritis, chronic pain,
                                    heart disease, and cancer. Adjusting to a chronic
                                    health condition can be a difficult and emotional
                                    process as it requires changes in lifestyle,
                                    relationships, and daily routines. The process of
                                    adjusting to a chronic health condition can be
                                    different for everyone. Therapy can help to integrate
                                    the diagnosis into your life, focusing on changing the
                                    aspects that can be controlled, and accepting the
                                    aspects that cannot be controlled. A significant
                                    aspect of adjusting to a chronic health condition is
                                    learning how to manage the physical and emotional
                                    effects of the condition. This can include learning
                                    how to manage pain, adapting to any restrictions, and
                                    finding ways to manage stress, anxiety and other
                                    emotions related to the condition.

                                <p>
                                    As human beings we all have needs for connectedness
                                    and intimacy. Relationships with others, whether
                                    romantic, friendships, family or professional
                                    relationships, are not always straightforward. Some
                                    people notice that there are patterns that they tend
                                    to repeat. Perhaps it can be difficult to get close to
                                    others emotionally, or there is a fear of abandonment
                                    or mistrust in others. For some others it may be
                                    difficult to keep healthy boundaries and have a
                                    tendency to be in co-dependent relationships. Often,
                                    early attachment relationships as well as trauma and
                                    loss can contribute to relationships difficulties.
                                    These difficulties can be limited to romantic
                                    relationships or present themselves across a range of
                                    relationships with others. Therapy can help you to
                                    identify patterns you may be repeating and explore any
                                    life experiences that may have contributed to them. It
                                    can also help you to break these patterns and make
                                    healthier choices.

                                <p>
                                    Stress is an inevitable part of modern life. A degree
                                    of stress can be helpful and can even focus
                                    performance, however, when it is prolonged, it can
                                    have a negative impact on our emotional and physical
                                    health and eventually lead to burnout. Stress can
                                    present itself as difficulties to switch off, feeling
                                    anxious and “wired”, irritable and tense. The body may
                                    also display signs of stress and many chronic health
                                    conditions can flare up during stressful periods. When
                                    reaching burnout, feeling exhausted, overwhelmed and
                                    hopeless are common. Unhealthy coping strategies such
                                    as using substances or overeating can also have a toll
                                    on the body and mind. Therapy can help you to
                                    understand the sources of stress and develop healthy
                                    coping strategies to respond to life challenges more
                                    effectively.

                                    Self-esteem is how we see and value ourselves. If we
                                    tend to see ourselves in a negative light, as a
                                    failure, not good enough, undeserving of love, this
                                    can have a profound influence on our life. It can
                                    affect how we think and talk to ourselves, being
                                    critical or having high, unrealistic expectations. It
                                    can impact on the confidence to achieve life’s goals,
                                    both personal and professional. It may mean not living
                                    up to one’s full potential or constantly feeling on
                                    the verge of being found out (the impostor syndrome).
                                    Therapy can help you to understand your unhelpful core
                                    beliefs about yourself and where they originate from.
                                    Personal history and societal influences can all play
                                    a role. It will also help you to build a healthier
                                    self esteem and changing any self-defeating patterns
                                    of thinking and behaving that are maintaining low self
                                    esteem.

                                    Self-sabotage can be seen as repeated unhealthy
                                    patterns in thinking and behaving that interfere with
                                    psychological wellbeing, relationships and growth,
                                    often keeping one from achieving personal goals.
                                    Self-sabotaging behaviours include procrastination,
                                    perfectionism and people pleasing. Addictive
                                    behaviours and impulses can also be conceptualised in
                                    this way, including substance misuse, comfort eating
                                    and gambling. These behaviours have usually developed
                                    initially as attempts to cope with unmet core needs
                                    for connection, or as an attempt to escape upsetting
                                    feelings. Often, part of the unintended consequences
                                    of these behaviours is that they perpetuate the very
                                    feelings they were initially developed to avoid and
                                    may, for example, increase feelings of shame or
                                    disconnection from others. Therapy can help to
                                    understand some of these self-defeating vicious cycles
                                    and to develop healthier coping strategies to break
                                    the cycles.

                            “When looking for a counselling psychologist, Dr Cigolla stood
                            out to me with her professional background and methods of
                            working. I got in touch with her directly to arrange a session
                            and she was very responsive and understanding from the get go.
                            When I had my first session with Dr Cigolla, I immediately
                            knew I made the right choice as I felt so at ease and
                            understood. Dr Cigolla listened to me with a lot of care and
                            we both spoke about what I would like to concentrate on more
                            and how we will approach it. Dr Cigolla is caring,
                            understanding and non-judgemental which to me are the most
                            important things when looking for a psychologist. She always
                            offers another way of looking at a situation which I deeply
                            appreciate. Dr Cigolla is a great professional and because of
                            her way of working and help, I have been able to improve many
                            aspects of my personal life and have been able to continue to
                            grow as a person. She has been my psychologist for the last 3
                            years and I will always return to her.”
