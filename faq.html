            <div class="faq-description">
                <h4>What can I expect from a first session?</h4>
                <p>
                    Starting therapy is a big step and it can be unsettling if you do not
                    know what to expect. In the first meeting, we will explore together
                    the issues that bring you to therapy and think about the options
                    available to you. We can think about what type of therapy would be
                    better for you and may agree to meet for a number of sessions.
                    However, there is no expectation that you start therapy after the
                    first session and we can have an open conversation about the best way
                    forward.
                </p>
                <h4>What about fees?</h4>
                <p>
                    For face to face sessions, my fee is £130 for a 50 minute session. ,
                    <br />
                    For online therapy, my fee is £110 for a 50 minute session.
                </p>
                <h4>Do you accept private health insurance?</h4>
                <p>
                    Yes, I am registered with all of the major heath insurances including
                    AXA PPP, BUPA, Simplyhealth, CIGNA, AVIVA, WPA and Pru Health. Fees
                    for private health insurance are higher due to the administrative
                    tasks involved. For payments, I will liaise directly with your
                    insurance company. To do this, I will need some details from you about
                    your health insurance and authorisation code. Health insurances
                    usually authorise an initial number of sessions or a particular budget
                    for therapy. On occasions, there is an excess to pay on the insurance
                    which needs to be paid to me directly.
                </h4>How long will I need therapy for?</h4>
                <p>
                    The number of sessions needed depends on your problems and goals. I
                    find it helpful to meet weekly to start with so that we can start
                    working effectively on the issues that brought you to therapy, making
                    sense of them first and then working on change. Later sessions can
                    happen fortnightly or sometimes even less frequently towards the end
                    to support you to maintain the progress you have made. After our first
                    appointment, I may be able to give you a clearer sense of roughly how
                    long we may need to work together. Having regular reviews is also a
                    feature of my way of working so that we can track your progress and
                    make sure that you are getting what you are hoping from therapy. Some
                    people may require six sessions or less to overcome a difficult period
                    or arrive at a healthier position. However, more commonly longer is
                    required to achieve therapy goals especially when problems may stem
                    from early trauma or there are problematic patterns of behaviour that
                    have become habitual. Some may achieve their initial treatment goal
                    early on in therapy, but may decide to stay in therapy for a longer
                    period to work through deeper relationship difficulties or because
                    they continue to benefit from the stability provided through a regular
                    therapy space.
                </p>
                <h4>Does online therapy work or is face to face therapy better?</h4>
                <p>
                    Online therapy has been in more demand given how convenient it is to
                    fit around busy lifestyles. It also makes it accessible for people who
                    do not have the option of seeing someone face to face. Research
                    suggests that online therapy is as effective as face to face therapy
                    and all of the therapeutic approaches I offer can be delivered online.
                    Of course, this doesn’t mean that online therapy is for everyone and
                    we can discuss this in the initial consultation.
                </p>
                <h4>What’s your cancellation policy?</h4>
                <p>
                    I have a 48 hours cancellation policy and will ask you to pay the fee
                    in full if you give me less than 48 notice.
                </p>
                <h4>Do you offer therapy in other languages?</h4>
                <p>I can offer therapy in Italian as well as English.</p>
