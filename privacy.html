                <h4>Reasons for collecting and processing information about you</h4>
                <p>
                    Dr Flavia Cigolla may collect information about you because you are a
                    client of hers. She has a legitimate interest in using the personal
                    data and sensitive personal data collected to provide health care and
                    treatment. The data collected is necessary to provide psychological
                    therapy.
                    <br />
                    You might also be asked for information on how you sourced Dr Flavia
                    Cigolla services for the purpose of anonymised marketing research. You
                    can choose not to disclose this information if you wish. No
                    information you provide is passed on without your consent. Dr Flavia
                    Cigolla will never sell your information to others.
                </p>
                <h4>What type of personal data is collected and processed?</h4>
                <p>

                            If you are referred by your health insurance provider,
                            solicitor, occupational health provider, or a case management
                            company, Dr Flavia Cigolla will also collect and process
                            personal data provided by that organisation. This includes
                            referral information and health insurance policy
                            number/solicitor, occupational health or case management
                            company case reference number, and authorisation details for

                <h4>Web access collection of information</h4>
                <p>
                    When you complete an online contact form Dr Flavia Cigolla will
                    collect information about you and your internet protocol (IP) address.
                    This is automatically supplied by the website software used to offer
                    the form. Dr Flavia Cigolla always tries to minimise the amount of
                    personal information that she requires to provide a specific service
                    or feature. All web services used by ‘Dr Flavia Cigolla’ and ‘name of
                    company’ are GDPR compliant.
                </p>
                <h4>How is my personal information used?</h4>
                <p>Dr Flavia Cigolla uses the information collected to:</p>
                <br />

                <ul>
                    <li>Provide services that you have requested from her.</li>
                    <li>Process and account for payment for such services.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    If you do not provide the personal information requested, then we may
                    be unable to provide a therapy service to you.

                <h4>How your personal information is stored</h4>
                <p>
                    Dr Flavia Cigolla takes your privacy very seriously. She is committed
                    to taking all reasonable steps to protect any individual identifying
                    information that you provide to her. Once we receive your data, she
                    makes best efforts to ensure its security on our systems. All personal
                    information provided is stored in compliance with EU General Data
                    Protection Regulations rules.
                </p>
                <h4>How long your personal information is stored for</h4>
                <p>
                    Dr Flavia Cigolla does not keep your data for longer than is
                    necessary. Basic contact information held on a therapist’s mobile
                    phone is deleted within 6 months of the end of therapy and the
                    sensitive personal data defined above is stored for a period of 7
                    years after the end of therapy. After this time, this data is deleted
                    at the end of each calendar year. Administrative data is retained for
                    up to six years as necessary, in the unlikely event there are queries
                    from HMRC and the VAT commissioner. Where it is not necessary to
                    retain the data for six years, it is destroyed as soon as possible.
                </p>
                <h4>Who we might share personal information with</h4>
                <p>
                    Dr Flavia Cigolla holds information about her clients and the therapy
                    they receive in confidence. However, in some circumstances she may
                    need to share information and liaise with other parties, as outlines
                    below:
                    <br />
                    <br />
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        If you are referred by your health insurance provider, or
                        otherwise claiming through a health insurance policy to fund
                        therapy, then we will share appointment schedules with that
                        organisation for the purposes of billing. She may also share
                        information with that organisation to provide treatment updates if
                        they request it or if you wish for Dr Flavia Cigolla to apply for
                        extra treatment sessions over and above those already funded.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In cases where treatment has been instructed by a solicitor or a
                        case management company or rehabilitation agency, relevant
                        clinical information from therapy records will be shared with
                        legal services as required and with your written consent.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    In exceptional circumstances, Dr Flavia Cigolla might need to share
                    personal information with relevant authorities:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        When there is need-to-know information for another health
                        provider, such as your GP.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        When disclosure is in the public interest, to prevent a
                        miscarriage of justice or where there is a legal duty, for example
                        a Court Order.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        When the information concerns risk of harm to the client, or risk
                        of harm to another adult or a child. She will discuss such a
                        proposed disclosure with you unless we believe that to do so could
                        increase the level of risk to you or to someone else.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h4>What we will NOT do with your personal information</h4>
                <p>
                    We will not share your personal information with third-parties for
                    marketing purposes or any unauthorised reason
                </p>
                <h4>How we ensure the security of personal information</h4>
                <p>
                    Personal information is minimised in phone and email communication.
                    Sensitive personal data will be sent to clients in an email attachment
                    that is password protected.

                    Dr Flavia Cigolla uses Transport Layer Security (TLS) to encrypt and
                    protect email traffic. If your email service does not support TLS, you
                    should be aware that any emails we send or receive may not be
                    protected in transit.
                    <br />
                    Personal information is stored on one laptop. This is password and
                    fingerprint protected and only accessed by Dr Flavia Cigolla. Malware
                    and antivirus protection is installed on all computing devices. Mobile
                    devices are protected with a passcode/thumbprint scanner and mobile
                    security.
                    <br />
                    All information recorded on paper will be securely stored in a locked
                    filing cabinet. If this is transported outside of the office, it will
                    remain in the confidential care of Dr Flavia Cigolla at all times.
                    <br />
                    Letters sent by surface mail (e.g. to GPs), will be clearly marked
                    Private and Confidential.
