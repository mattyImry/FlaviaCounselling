                        Central to my way of working is offering a non-judgemental, safe
                        and relaxed therapeutic environment where clients can feel
                        understood and reflect on their experiences. Establishing a
                        genuine and warm therapeutic relationship is key. I am interested
                        in the uniqueness of each individual’s experience and how the
                        relationship with oneself, others and the world shape how people
                        operate in their environment and give meaning to their experience.
                        I strongly believe that my approach needs to be tailored to the
                        needs of each individual and I integrate the therapeutic models I
                        am trained it to find the best fit for you.

                    I have 15 years experience of working within different NHS services
                    alongside my private practice, which was established in 2012. My most
                    recent role in the NHS is working as a Senior Psychologist in a
                    Chronic Pain Service. Other services I have worked in include a
                    primary care psychology service, a Community Mental Health Team, and a
                    specialist personality disorder service In these settings, I have
                    worked both short-term and long-term with clients experiencing a broad
                    range of emotional and psychological difficulties from mild depression
                    and anxiety to complex trauma and difficulties managing strong
                    emotions. I have also worked with people who live with chronic health
                    conditions, in particular chronic pain, to help them adjust to their
                    condition.

                    In 2011, I completed a Doctorate in Psychotherapeutic and Counselling
                    Psychology at the University of Surrey. During my training I was
                    exposed to various therapeutic models (Psychodynamic, Person-centred
                    and
                    <a class="about_page-Link" href="cbt.html">

                    </a>
                    ). Being trained in using different therapeutic approaches allows me
                    to integrate them in a creative way taking into account the client’s
                    individual needs and preferences. I also have a personal and research
                    interest in mindfulness and I draw from the new developments in
                    mindfulness-based therapies to help clients become more aware of
                    unhelpful patterns and develop the ability to be more present in their
                    lives. In particular, I use Acceptance and

                    in my work. Learning never stops as a psychologist and I very much
                    value developing my therapeutic skills. Since qualifying, I have
                    trained in

                    looks at patterns of relating to others that usually stem from
                    childhood and impact on current relationships with both self and
                    others. I have also completed
